## Step 1 - Installing VScode

If you do not already have VScode installed, go the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/. Follow the on-screen instructions and download the correct version for your computer. 
Once VScode has been successfully installed, this is what it should (in general) look like.

2. Once logged in, your CSE15L account should start with "cs15lsp23" followed by 2 unique characters. ![Image](Screen Shot 2023-04-07 at 9.19.51 AM.png)

4. Open up a terminal in VScode.
